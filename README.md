This repository contains the materials for D-Labâ€™s **SQL Fundamentals** workshop series, focusing on SQL for data science using Python and SQLite.

### Prerequisites
No prior SQL experience is required. However, experience with Python and some familiarity with pandas is recommended.

Check D-Lab's [Learning Pathways](https://dlab-berkeley.github.io/dlab-workshops/python_path.html) to figure out which of our workshops to take!

## Workshop Overview

This workshop introduces the fundamentals of SQL, with a focus on using SQLite for data science tasks. We'll explore how SQL can be used to query and manipulate relational databases, leveraging pandas to interact with the results in Python. This hands-on workshop includes exercises based on real-world datasets.

### Key Topics Covered
- Introduction to SQL and relational databases
- SQLite setup and integration with Python (pandas)
- Basic SQL operations: SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, and more
- Querying SQLite databases with pandas
- Working with real-world datasets

## Learning Objectives

After completing **SQL Fundamentals**, you will be able to:
- Understand the basic structure and purpose of relational databases.
- Perform basic SQL operations such as `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY`.
- Execute SQL queries on an SQLite database.
- Use Python's `sqlite3` and `pandas` to interact with databases.
- Join tables and perform aggregations to answer data analysis questions.
- Understand the workflow of querying data for analysis in Python.

This workshop does **not** cover the following:
- Advanced database management or indexing.
- SQL optimizations for large datasets.
- Non-relational databases or other SQL variants like PostgreSQL.

## Workshop Structure

The workshop is divided into multiple parts, with a focus on hands-on coding and problem-solving:

1. **Part 1: Introduction to SQL and Relational Databases**
   - Overview of relational databases and SQL
   - Setting up SQLite and using it in Python
2. **Part 2: Querying Data**
   - Basic SQL commands: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
   - Filtering and sorting data
3. **Part 3: Aggregations and Grouping**
   - `GROUP BY`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, and other aggregation functions
   - Advanced filtering with `HAVING`
4. **Part 4: Joining Tables**
   - Understanding joins: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and more
   - Combining data from multiple tables
5. **Part 5: SQL with Python**
   - Using `sqlite3` in Python to run SQL queries
   - Querying databases and processing results with `pandas`
6. **Part 6: Data Analysis Project**
   - Final project: real-world data analysis using SQLite and pandas

Each part of the workshop will include hands-on exercises to reinforce key concepts and skills. Instructors and TAs are available to assist with questions and debugging.
